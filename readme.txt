# Multi-Model Classification for X-Ray Images

This repository provides a multi-model training environment for classifying chest X-ray images into four categories. The project allows efficient training, validation, and comparison of multiple models while tracking key performance metrics.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Supports multiple deep learning models
- Handles classification for **four** X-ray classes
- Tracks performance metrics: **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score**
- Saves model training history and comparison results, confusion matrix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:  
[ðŸ”— Chest X-ray Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis)  

Ensure you download and structure the dataset correctly before training.
